FarmChainX

Status: Work in Progress (WIP)

🚀 Overview

FarmChainX is an AI and blockchain-powered supply chain platform built for the agriculture industry. It ensures transparency, traceability, and authenticity for farm products — from the farmer’s field to the consumer’s hands. The project combines Spring Boot for backend APIs, blockchain for tamper-proof records, and AI for quality checks and demand forecasting.

🌾 How It Works

👨‍🌾 Farmer

Registers and uploads product details such as name, category, quantity, harvest date, and photos.

Each product batch receives a unique blockchain entry for traceability.

Can view AI-based quality scores generated from uploaded images.

🚚 Distributor

Views available products from farmers and purchases them in batches.

Updates transportation and storage details, recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Uses AI-based demand forecasts to optimize logistics and inventory.

🧾 Quality Auditor

Reviews product and batch details submitted by farmers and distributors.

Uses blockchain logs to verify authenticity and detect tampering.

Approves or flags batches based on AI-assisted quality results.

🛒 Retailer / Consumer

Can track a product’s complete journey from farm to shelf.

Verifies product authenticity, quality, and sustainability data stored on blockchain.

Gains trust and confidence in organic and eco-friendly products.
